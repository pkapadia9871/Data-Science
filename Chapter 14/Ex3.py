##Write a GUI program that calculates a car’s gas mileage.
##The program’s window should have Entry widgets that
##let the user enter the number of gallons of gas the car holds,
##and the number of miles it can be driven on a full tank.
##When a Calculate MPG button is clicked, the program should
##display the number of miles that the car may be driven per gallon of gas.
##Use the following formula to calculate miles-per-gallon:

import tkinter
import tkinter.messagebox

class MilesPerGallonGui:
        def_init_(self)

            self.main_window = tkinter.Tk()
